# 🧩 Sudoku 2026 — The Puzzle Game That Judges You

> _"Why did the Sudoku puzzle break up with the crossword? Because it found someone who really understood its numbers."_ 💔🔢

Welcome to the most beautiful Sudoku game on the internet. Yes, we're biased. No, we don't care. 😎

## 🤔 What Is This?

It's Sudoku. You know, that game your grandma does on the toilet. Except this one is ✨ modern ✨ and ✨ fancy ✨ and runs in your browser like it pays rent there.

Fill a 9×9 grid with numbers 1-9 so that each **row**, **column**, and **3×3 box** contains every digit exactly once. Simple rules. Impossible vibes. Welcome to pain. 🫠

## 🎮 How To Play

1. **Pick your poison** 🧪 — Choose a difficulty level:

   | Level | Vibe | Base Points | Time Bonus |
   |-------|------|:-----------:|:----------:|
   | 🟢 Easy | _"I just woke up"_ | 100 | +200 |
   | 🔵 Medium | _"I've had my coffee"_ | 250 | +500 |
   | 🟠 Hard | _"I enjoy suffering"_ | 500 | +1,000 |
   | 🔴 Expert | _"I am the danger"_ | 1,000 | +2,000 |

2. **Tap a cell** 👆 — Select where you want to place a number
3. **Tap a number** 🔢 — Fill it in and pray you're right
4. **Don't mess up** 🙏 — Each mistake costs you 25 points and a tiny piece of your dignity

## 🧠 Pro Tips (You'll Need Them)

- 📝 **Notes Mode** — Toggle it to pencil in candidates. It's like thinking out loud, but quieter.
- 💡 **Hints** — You get 3 per game. Use them wisely. Or panic-click them all in the first minute. We don't judge. _(We judge a little.)_
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts** — Because clicking is for casuals:
  - `1-9` → Place a number
  - `Arrow keys` → Navigate the grid like a boss
  - `N` → Toggle notes mode
  - `Backspace` → Erase your regrets
- 🌙 **Dark Mode** — For when you're solving puzzles at 2 AM questioning your life choices
- 💾 **Auto-Save** — Close the browser, take a nap, come back tomorrow. Your game will be right where you left it. Unlike your motivation. 😅

## ⚡ The Scoring System

Made with ❤️, ☕, and an unreasonable amount of `console.log` statements that have since been removed.
